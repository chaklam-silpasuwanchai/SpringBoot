# SpringBoot

I have created a repository for demonstrating basic concepts of Spring Boot.

This repository is served as a teaching materials for **Software Architecture Design** which will focus on Enterprise Architectural Patterns, Enterprise Integration Patterns, and Microservices.

This github is best used with the lab step-by-step guides: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13fDG9ui4xQ7_zKUgBbxWePZLE97MuXvY?usp=sharing

**Important Notes**: The lab manuals may be outdated after a while, since most of these libraries version update every 6 months ago.  Most of these manuals should work fine, but feel free to update these dependencies to its latest version.

Topics include:
1. Design Patterns (GoF)
2. MVC and Restful apis (a quick recap)
3. Domain Model Logic
   - Transaction Script
   - Domain Model
4. Object-Database Mapping (Hibernate)
5. Spring Session and Security
   - Authorization and Authentication
   - Database Session state
6. Asychronous communication
7. Spring Integration
   - One to One
   - Publish-Subscribe
8. Microservices with Eureka
9. Microsevices with Kubernete
